# QRTC Transit

Formal kernel for QRTC Transit analysis.

This project compares an implemented Gate against a declared future family and classifies the relationship as exact, insufficient, excessive, or incomparable.

## CI and Dependency Audit

- Quality gates run on push and pull request for transit changes via [../.github/workflows/qrtc-transit-ci.yml](../.github/workflows/qrtc-transit-ci.yml).
- A scheduled dependency audit runs weekly (and can be run manually) via [../.github/workflows/qrtc-transit-audit.yml](../.github/workflows/qrtc-transit-audit.yml).

### Viewing Audit Artifacts

1. Open the repository Actions tab.
2. Select the "QRTC Transit Dependency Audit" workflow run.
3. Open the run artifacts named `qrtc-transit-pip-audit-<run_id>`.
4. Download and review:
	- `pip-audit.json`
	- `pip-audit-summary.md`
